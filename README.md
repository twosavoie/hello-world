# hello-world
Using Github's guide
trying to learn how to better use github
just trying to figure out how to make this all work
continuous practice
starting to see what is happening
this is starting to feel more comfortable
I think I've almost got it
going to click around a little
ok, so I can keep branch? why? huh.
so this is my first commit right?
and this is my second commit right?
and the third
so time to create a pull request
